# Personal Context and Motivation

##  Overview
My unique combination of philology and technical knowledge has its roots in practical experience.  
From an early age, I spent time with my father in the garage, “helping” with motorcycle repairs.  
Most often, these were Polish brands such as **WSK, Komar, Junak**, or the German **MZ**.

##  Early Experience
I carried out tasks that required precision and small hands, such as cleaning carburetor jets.  
It was my father who showed me what an engine looks like inside—teaching me that every complex system is a collection of logically connected, yet independent parts.

##  Connection to Technical Writing
This practice became the direct foundation of my work as a **Technical Writer**, **Technical Translator** and **Technical English Teacher**:  
- Understanding how devices function.  
- Simplifying complex procedures.  
- Making technical processes clear and accessible to everyone.

##  Key Takeaway
My background blends **linguistic expertise** with **hands-on technical insight**, enabling me to create documentation that bridges complexity and clarity.
